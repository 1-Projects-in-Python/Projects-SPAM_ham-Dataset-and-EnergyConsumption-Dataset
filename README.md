# Projects-SPAM_Ham-Dataset-and-EnergyConsumption-Dataset
This repository encompasses two distinct projects:  

Project 1: Text classification for the SPAM/HAM dataset using Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.  

Project 2: Comparative analysis of energy consumption prediction. Employing Stochastic Gradient Regressor with various K-Cross folds vs Random Forest Regression, incorporating different regularization methods in both scenarios.
